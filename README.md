# solana-smart-contract

The purpose of the code is to define a Solana program instruction handler that transfers tokens from one account to another using the SPL Token program.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

The function process_instruction is the entry point for the Solana program and is called when the program receives an instruction.

The function takes in several parameters: _program_id (the ID of the program), accounts (an array of account information), and _instruction_data (the instruction data passed to the program).

The code uses the solana_program and spl_token libraries, which are Solana-specific libraries for program development and token operations.

The function retrieves the necessary account information from the accounts array using the next_account_info function, which returns the next account in the iterator.

It checks if the owner account is a signer. If it's not a signer, it returns an error (ProgramError::InvalidSeeds).

The code then prepares the transfer_checked instruction, which is a function provided by the SPL Token program. It specifies the token program ID, source account, destination account, owner account, and other parameters for the token transfer.

The code invokes the token program's transfer_checked instruction using the invoke function. It passes the instruction, along with the required account information, to execute the token transfer.

The function returns Ok(()) if the transfer is successful.
